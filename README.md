# Deliverable 1
## Which variables provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values? 


ground clearance and vehicle lenght 
## Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? why and why not 

It's not considered zero as there are 2 values that influences the linear model. at least some 
slope.

## Does this linear model predict mpg of mechacar efficiently? 

It does some kind of good aproximation as r-squared is equal to 0.71, this mean at least 50% of accuracy.

# Deliverable 2 

## Variance should not exceed 100 pounds

The variance only for 2, lot 3 has a variance more than allowed and should be taking to observation 
as it doesnt comply with standard design specification

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

As the data we have from the MechaCar reflects mpg and it was found it was somewhat reliable to take it as a statistically significant, we could compare with dataset of mpg of different brands.

We can compare with Highway Miles per Galon consumed as they're the 
highest values 

See if Horsepower vs mpg is similar or better relationship with other cars. 

Waht metrics?
Null/alternative hypothesis?
What test and why?
What data is needed?
